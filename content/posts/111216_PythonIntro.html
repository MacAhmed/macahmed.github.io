                I have just started doing the Python course by Google. I am also using a book called Python Programming -
                An introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle as a supplement to learn more.

                Python is a dynamic, interpreted ( byte-code compiled ) language. A dynamic language is one that performs
                many tasks during runtime that are normally performed by static languages during compilation. These kind
                languages are often referred to as scripting languages. An interpreted language is one whose instructions
                are executed directly, without previous compilation. However, Python is not strictly a interpreted language.
                It creates an Intermediate Representation, a data structure or code used internally by a VM or a compiler
                which represents the source code. The IR is then compiled everytime there is some sort of change in the
                source code.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are no type declarations for variables, parameters, functions etc. The source files using .py as a
                file extension and are called modules.
            </p>

            <pre><code>import sys
def main():
    print 'Hello there,', sys.argv[1]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()</code></pre>

            <p>
                The above code is simple program that will print out 'Hello there,' followed by the 2nd command line argument.
                <code>import sys</code> imports a library module called sys which provides standard system-related functions.
                <code>def</code> is the keyword used to define functions and is followed by the name of the functions and then
                colon. This is then followed by the standard print statement. <code>sys.argv[1]</code> allows access to the
                second element in the array <code>argv</code>. The 1st element of the argv array is the name of the program.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> is a standard boilerplate code used to indicate which function
                must be called first. It states if the the filename is 'main' then run the main function. The actions taken
                such as running the main functions can be replaced with anything as it long they have been defined beforehand.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a module is run directly either from the command-line or some GUI element, its important to have the
                <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> block, to indicate what functions will start the program.
            </p>

            <pre><code>def repeat(s, exclaim):
    result = s + s + s
    if exclaim:
        result = result + '!!!'
return result</code></pre>

        </div>

        <p>
            The above is anther simple function that repeats a certain string 3 times, and add 3 exclamations depending
            upon parameters provided. The function is first defined using <code>def repeat(s, exclaim)</code>, where def
            is followed by the name of the function, and then its parameters in brackets. <code>result = s + s + s</code>
            adds 3 instances of the strings and therefore repeats it 3 times. A faster way to perform this is by doing
            <code>s*3</code>, which is faster as the length of the string is only calculated once, while it is calculated
            each time its added during  <code>s + s + s</code>. <code>if exclaim:</code> where exclaim is either <code>
            True</code> or <code>False</code> is a statement that decides whether or not exclamation points are to be
            included. The variable <code>result</code> is then returned by the method calling the function.
        </p>

            Python is a little different from languages in sense that whitespace indentation affects how a program is
            interpreted. A logical block of statements such as a if statement, a function, loop etc should have the
            same indentation. Python Official Style Guide recommends use of 4 space indentation but it can be 2 spaces as
            well as long as it is consistent.
        </p>

        <p>
            All type, name etc checks are performed at runtime, on each line as it runs. This means that more rigorous
            testing is required to ensure all possible branches of the program are free of errors. One might miss an error
            under a if statement if that statement is not explored during testing.
        </p>

            Suppose a module is called <code>module1</code> and has a method called <code>method1</code>, then its fully
            qualified name is <code>module1.method1</code>. The modules can be imported using the <code>import</code> statement
            and then their methods can be used by using their complete name. There are two ways to import resources in Python.
            One, simply using a <code>import</code> statement, and indicating which module is required. Second, is like
            <code>from sys import argv,exit</code>, which imports two resources from the module sys called argv and exit().
            These can then be used in the module without being referred to by their complete name. This is however, not
            encouraged. Some of the common library modules are sys, re, os etc. The <code>help()</code> statement can be
            used to pull up documentation strings for methods, modules etc.
