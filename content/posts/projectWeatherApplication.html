                I recently completed a fairly simple Weather Application. The application displays the weather information
                for wherever you are located for the next 5 days. I am sure most of my code is very buggy and hacky, however
                it is the first actual application that i have developed so i am still excited regardless.
            </p>

                So, the basic HTML page is defined using Bootstrap. I feel that it is a bit of a overkill since i only
                really used it for the grid system. I might be replacing this in the future with just standard CSS instead of
                Bootstrap. I feel that its too heavy a library and does take a lot of time in loading and slows the website by 296.22â€‰ms
                each time it loads and this is without throttling. Using the site on GPRS throttling leads to a 11.47sec delay only due to
                Bootstrap. I have also used jQuery which again, might be a bit too much of an overkill. It has only been used
                sparingly. Its taking 605.51ms to load on WiFi and 12.65sec on GPRS, which again seems too much of a delay.

                These are both things that i will need to either remove outright or find a way to reduce amount of time taken.
            </p>

            <p>
                The icons i have used are another CSS library, called <a href="https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons">Weather Icons</a>.
                I do not regret using this as its been extremely useful and it was quite helpful having a set of icons that went together.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Javascript function that updates and basically renders the page is found in one file called <code>app.js</code>.
                There is one main function that provides most of the functionality. Using a <code>$(document).ready</code> to start the main code.
                I then use the geolocation api to get the currentPosition, prase it into the URL and then get the JSON returned and save it in a variable.
                I then run a loop that goes through the JSON array as well as the items on my page and updates them according to the data in JSON.
            </p>

            <p>
                I created three helper functions <code>getAPIData(restURL)</code>, <code>dayOfWeekAsString(dayIndex)</code>, <code>provideIcon(iconID)</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>getAPIData(restURL)</code> feels like to me that its a waste and there has to exist some function that
                potentially perform this task better. I have imported jQuery but am not sure if a function like such exists.

                <pre><code>function getAPIData(restURL){
    var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhttp.open("GET", restURL , false);
    xhttp.send();
    var response = JSON.parse(xhttp.responseText);

    return response;
}</code></pre>

                The above technique of doing this is something that i think is not strictly correct. This is because, when used,
                i am getting a error message in the console like so : <code>Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.<br> For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
        </code> Also, its extremely slow.

                The other two functions just create Array's and provide information depending on the parameter passed. Fairly simple.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, i will be trying to create basically the same sort of application but as a Command line tool in Python.
