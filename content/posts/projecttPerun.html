                So, First of all, Happy New Year. It is 2017. I am now starting
                a new project that i think will be benefical for me. I am trying
                to create a weather application, one that works in the terminal,
                similar to <a href="https://github.com/schachmat/wego">wego</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the goal is to create it in as many different languages
              as i possibly can. I just started with Python and will giving Golang
              a shot, next. The goal is try to keep the amount of time i spend on
              each application fairly constant. This way i get to see, as to how many
              features i can add to one application in that specific language in a
              period of time. Of course, this is very dependent on a person's ability
              to work in that language. However, i haven't really worked in any of these
              languages before. Python is something i am fairly new to and that is
              quite evident from my code, which you can check <a href="https://github.com/MacAhmed/tPerun">here</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              I think this will be quite helpful in giving me a very quick intro,
              to many languages. Possibly even a challenge in some languages considering
              i am planning to use some very esoteric languages for the challenge.

              Let's say i use BrainFuck or even C for the matter. Both are languages that
              have their own challenges in this matter. The project also shows how one
              language simply cannot / should not be used for every project.

              Regardless, its something that i think should be quite fun.
